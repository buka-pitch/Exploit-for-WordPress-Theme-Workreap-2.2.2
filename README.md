# Exploit-for-WordPress-Theme-Workreap-2.2.2
Python Exploit Unauthenticated Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution


# CVE-2021-24499

`
The Workreap WordPress theme before 2.2.2 AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.
